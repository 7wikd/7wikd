### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 I'm Satwik Dalvi, a Junior pursuing Information Technology at Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Pune. 
 I enthusiastically indulge in articles based on the workings of Machine Learning algorithms, as well as the Principles of Mathematics. Why? Cuz I like that.
 
 ## Moving on...
 ### I'm currently working on...
 Deep Learning Projects that revolve around Speech and Medical Imaging.
 Projects also include Hardware and Sensing, as I used to study Electronics during High School
 
 ### I'm looking to collaborate on...
 Research projects that involve hands-on working environments (mostly in the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning).
